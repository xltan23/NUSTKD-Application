            <h3>Our Head Coach</h3>
            <p>"I started Taekwondo at the age of 9 and never left it since. My Father was the one who encouraged me to take up this sport and 
                he became both my <br> 
                mentor and personal coach. He trained me to be one of the best fighters in Singapore during the late 80s and 
                early 90s. I participated in the 1987, <br>
                1989 & 1993 SEA Games of which I won Silver and Gold medals in 1989 and 1993 respectively.
                I also participated in multiple local competitions <br>
                sanctioned by STF and won gold medals for my category. My passion for the sport
                will never die and my motto is to keep training and stay mentally <br>
                strong and fit."
